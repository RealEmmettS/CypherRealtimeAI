# Best Buy Search Term Breakdown Guide

## Overview
When processing customer product requests, break down search terms into simple, atomic components that can be effectively used for searching. This helps ensure more accurate and relevant results.

## Methodology

1. Break down product requests into core components:
   - Product type/category
   - Key specifications
   - Size/dimensions
   - Technical requirements

2. Examples:

### Example 1: "I want an outdoor tv for my texas patio and it should be big"
Break down into:
- "tv"      (product type)
- "outdoor" (key specification)
- "65"      (size - default for "big")
or
- "tv"      (product type)
- "outdoor" (key specification)
- "75"      (size - alternative for "big")

### Example 2: "Macbook pro m4 14-inch with at least 24gb of ram"
Break down into:
- "macbook" (product type)
- "pro"     (model)
- "m4"      (version)
- "14"      (size)
- "24"      (RAM specification)

## Guidelines

1. Always start with the base product type (tv, laptop, phone, etc.)
2. Follow with key identifying features (outdoor, pro, gaming, etc.)
3. Include specific measurements (screen size, memory, etc.)
4. Convert descriptive terms to specific values:
   - "big" → "65" or "75" for TVs
   - "small" → appropriate size for product category
   - "powerful" → relevant specs for category

## Benefits

- More precise search results
- Better matching of customer needs
